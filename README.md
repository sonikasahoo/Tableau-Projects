Objectives : 
1. Calculate Attrition Rate
2. Analyze Factors Influencing Attrition

Observations:
1. Tenure and Attrition: Employees with 2 to 5 years of tenure have the highest tendency to leave the company, indicating a critical retention phase. Remarkably, attrition drops to 0% after 10 years of service.
2. Age Group and Attrition: The age group of 26 to 33 years exhibits the highest attrition rates, with notable peaks at ages 29 and 31. This suggests mid-career employees are more prone to turnover.
3. Role-Specific Attrition:
   The Lab Technician role has the highest number of attritions, followed by Sales Executives, Research Scientists, and Sales Representatives.
   While the count is highest for Lab Technicians, Sales Representatives have the highest percentage of attrition relative to their total role count, indicating role-specific dissatisfaction.

Conclusion:
Employee retention efforts should focus on mid-tenure employees (2-5 years) and those in their late 20s and early 30s, as they are the most vulnerable to attrition.
Targeted interventions like career progression opportunities, competitive compensation, and skill development programs can help retain talent in critical roles like Lab Technicians and Sales Representatives.
For long-term employees (10+ years), the 0% attrition rate suggests strong loyalty, which can be leveraged for mentorship or leadership programs.
